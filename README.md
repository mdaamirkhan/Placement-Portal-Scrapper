# Placement-Portal-Scrapper

## Installations
Install python and pip(python package installer) on your machine.
Clone the project on your machine. Open terminal in the folder having the code files and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
In the Credentials.txt file, write your username and password (used to access the placement portal) in the first line as follows:
```
<username>,<password>
```

After editing the Credentials.txt file, run the following command:
```
python scrapper.py
```

Now you can sit back and focus on your placement preparation while the scrapper does the boring job of looking if a new company has registered and will notify you if it sees a new company registered on the portal.
